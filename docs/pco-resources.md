# Partial Common Ownership Resources

> Partial common ownership is a new way of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.
>
> In partial common ownership systems (also known under the acronyms COST and SALSA), assets belong to no one and everyone. An assetâ€™s current possessor, must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend. If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.
