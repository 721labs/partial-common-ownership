# Partial Common Ownership Tokens

[![tests](https://github.com/721labs/partial-common-ownership/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/721labs/partial-common-ownership/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

## Overview

This project aims to establish a standard, open source implementation of Partial Common Ownership for non-fungible tokens. It builds upon work done by RadicalxChange, Simon de la Rouviere, and others.

### Partial Common Ownership

> Partial common ownership is a new way of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.
>
> In partial common ownership systems (also known under the acronyms COST and SALSA), assets belong to no one and everyone. An assetâ€™s current possessor, must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend. If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.

## Installing

Using npm:

```shell
$ npm i @721labs/partial-common-ownership --save-dev
```

Using yarn:

```shell
$ yarn add @721labs/partial-common-ownership --dev
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts by importing and inheriting from them:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "./PartialCommonOwnership721.sol";

/// @dev 100% patronage
contract YourToken is PartialCommonOwnership721 {
  constructor()
    PartialCommonOwnership721(
      "YourToken",
      "TOKEN",
      payable(msg.sender),
      1000000000000,
      365
    )
  {}
}

```

## Security

**Please note that `PartialCommonOwnership721.sol` is in early-development has not been independently audited for security**. While the maintainers strive to ensure best practices, we are not responsible for loss-of-funds resulting from usage of Partial Common Ownership.

Please report any security issues you find in [Issues](https://github.com/721labs/partial-common-ownership/issues).

## Development

### Installation

```console
$ ./scripts/install.sh
```

### Gas

The Partial Common Ownership business logic is fairly complex and, in alignment with best practices, you should consider gas usage during development. To make this easier, `hardhat-gas-reporter` is included.

When tests are run, it calculates the average gas usage of frequently used methods and prints these figures to stdout. Viewing gas costs as USD requires setting the `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env`.
