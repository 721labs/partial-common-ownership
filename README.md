# Partial Common Ownership Tokens

[![tests](https://github.com/721labs/partial-common-ownership/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/721labs/partial-common-ownership/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

## Overview

This project aims to establish a standard, open source implementation of Partial Common Ownership for ERC721, ERC1155 and future non-fungible tokens.  It builds upon work done by RadicalxChange, Simon de la Rouviere, and others.

### Partial Common Ownership

> Partial common ownership is a new way of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.
>
> In partial common ownership systems (also known under the acronyms COST and SALSA), assets belong to no one and everyone. An assetâ€™s current possessor, must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend. If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "./PartialCommonOwnership721.sol";

/// @dev 100% patronage
contract YourToken is PartialCommonOwnership721 {
  constructor()
    PartialCommonOwnership721(
      "Your Token",
      "TOKEN",
      payable(msg.sender),
      1000000000000
    )
  {}
}
```
